# DESN2003 Visualisation Projects

## Notes

* [Link to the ACT open data](https://www.data.act.gov.au)

* [List of various visualisation charts](https://datavizcatalogue.com/)

## Improvements

* Change font types
* Add some comments, insights, etc
* Add the source of the data

* Street lights:
  * Reduce the radius of the fuzzy circles
  * Maybe add the total count of each lamp
  * Make the info box static at the bottom corner
  * Make it easy to tell which one we are hovering over (maybe add an thick outline to the lights that we are hovering over)
  * When turning off the lights, maybe make the colour gray as well, just like how the switch is gray

* Transport:
  * Pie chart, instead of animating it from the start, just make it so that it animates however much difference there is
  * Layout of the visuals
